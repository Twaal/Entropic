## Site Specific Art 2022 <br>
Here are some examples of touch-reactive generative artworks. This was for an art project I was working on at BU. There is a large, 6x10 foot touchscreen at the entrabce to the college of engineering. I was in contact with the dean and the head of engineering IT to create content for this display. <br>
